•	To allow all user to view active property in the system <br>
•	To allow user to register an account to be a possible tenant <br>
•	To allow possible tenant to edit profile <br>
•	To allow system admin to view and manage property, such as deleting, activating, and inactivating the property <br>
•	To allow system admin to print report of the property or user list <br><br>
