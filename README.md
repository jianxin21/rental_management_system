# rental_management_system

Cyberjaya Online Rental Management System is a system that allows users to view real properties that are managed by the system admin. After launching the system, all users can view the property without an account; the user can also search property according to the property type. If a user wishes to be a possible tenant, one can register an account for more features. <br><br> The objectives of this system include: <br><br>
•	To allow all user to view active property in the system <br>
•	To allow user to register an account to be a possible tenant <br>
•	To allow possible tenant to edit profile <br>
•	To allow system admin to view and manage property, such as deleting, activating, and inactivating the property <br>
•	To allow system admin to print report of the property or user list <br><br>

The assumptions in this project include: <br><br>
•	All property in Cyberjaya Online Rental Management System is managed by the admin; the user is either a user without an account or a possible tenant with an account. There is no property agent or property owner. <br>
•	Rent property feature for a tenant is not included in this system, major features for a possible tenant are currently limited to edit profile and view active property <br>
•	The program can run on BlueJ or command prompt <br>
